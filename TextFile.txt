	1. Download and run Etcher.
	2. Plug in your memory card into your computer.
	3. You memory card will appear as a generic storage device. Select it and then select the Flash button.
	4. This will take a few minutes. After the drive is flashed, Windows will ask to format the drive. Do not accept. We want to keep the Pi's OS installed.
